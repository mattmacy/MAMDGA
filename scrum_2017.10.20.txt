# Week of 2017.10.11
Monday: Characterize power on reset issue (host needed to be rebooted to restore device
        to a state that the driver could attach to) when passing AMD Fury through to bhyve.
Tuesday: 
    - Install GP100 and Frontier Vega in desktop. 
    - Passthrough GP100 to Bhyve. 
    - Find that GP100 doesn’t support FLR. 
    - Spend most of the day finding the magic combination of driver and CUDA to make 
      CUDA samples work under Ubuntu 16.04.3. 
    - Confirm that SGEMM performance is the same on bare metal as in bhyve.
Wednesday: 
    - Look in to resources for POR. 
Thursday: 
    - Fix POR issue with small change to ppt(4). 
    - Declare GPU support “done” for purposes of PoC on FreeBSD/bhyve.

# Week of 2017.10.18
Monday: 
    - Familiarize self with VALE. 
    - Initial “managed soft switch” implementation enforcing isolation by “subnet
      id” (essentially transparent VLANs).
    - Implement ioctl configuration interfaces. 
    - Generalize internal interfaces so as to avoid code duplication and keep original
      VALE essentially unmodified.
Tuesday: 
    - Implement default packet checking policies. 
    - Update configuration interface.
Wednesday: 
    - Welcome to SCRUM!
    - Planned: 
        - Start work on user land bridge w/ focus on RPC configuration interface.
